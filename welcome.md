## Welcome Tacoma Javascripter,

Over the last many meetups I have had a chance to
meet members once or more and learned a bit about
what and why you are trying to improve your web
programming skills, including javascsripting.  I
have tried to capture some of what I have learned
in the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/JoeDevlin2)
 for the next meeting or in my web [book](http://vividventures.biz/d/?q=javascript).
This includes [editors](http://www.vividventures.biz/d/?q=text_editors),
[code schools](http://vividventures.biz/d/?q=javascript#code-schools),
and key topics that members, students, developers and managers
have suggested.

### Overview

See this letter [posted](https://github.com/Tacoma-JS/Tacoma-JS.github.io/blob/master/welcome.md) on our meetup site.

When you signed up for this meetup there were two
profile questions / hints regarding:
* [codepen free](https://codepen.io/signup/free)
* [github join](https://github.com/join)

to help you get started in the meetup.  These were
not idle "what's up?" kinds of questions but rather
_strong_ hints about how to engage with the meetup.
If you have not created an account with these powerful
complimentary collaboration tools it is strongly
recommended right now.

Although everyone who signs up says they are a
beginner we have found there are some who arrive with
years of programming experience and need to add
another language to their tool chest and others who
are truly just beginning their studies.

To meet the varied interests we have switched between
front end browser user interface topics and backend
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) topics.  I especially
would like to thank our experienced members for sharing
at [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/tacoma/). We have
a github [organization](https://github.com/Tacoma-JS)
for practicing coding and project collaboration.
Various meeting times have been offered with varied
success.  There is no one topic or meeting time that
satisfies everyones need on the same day.  We just
put it out there and work with whomever attends.

One comment the newly initiated often make is "How
does javascript fit into a web page?"  They see the
simple example mocked up in fiddle or codepen and
know that the example is contrived and not exactly
the real thing.  They want to know how to make the
leap from writing example code to weaving it into
their own web page.  A quick solution in codepen
is to use the share button to download a zip file
of the project to a working directory on your
local drive or remote web server. Once unzipped a
real web index.html page and subdirectories are
extracted.  You can then inspect and test the
example files to get an understanding for how they
are related and function in the browser without
the pen [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28software_development%29).

Check out the [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/)
introductory videos:

[Quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_k03JH3b24)
* [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJw_9cyr0vI)
* [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWODB684vhw)
* [JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgB5ncR4ygA)

Coding is definitely nontrivial and requires
significant dedication to achieve the skills.
The good news is that excellent complimentary
courses are available for Tacoma Pierce County
[Library](http://www.piercecountylibrary.org/) cardholders
through:
* [Teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/gateways/pierce_county_public_library/signup?)
* [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=piercecountylibrary.org)

Sign up right now, it will be well worth your effort.
There are single courses, introductory courses and
tracks that lead to a full suite of knowledge.  While
we may spend a couple hours a month at a meetup, the
reality is that you need set time to practice each day
to improve your skill. How soon do you want to
achieve your goal?

After successfully building a fantastic front end
web page with a wonderful [user-experience](http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html) based on a robust data model driven by
the best user story ever; one may ask "How do I make
my web pages communicate with my web server and database
to store and retrieve my data.  An experienced developer
might even suggest designing the data model and database
first.  Communication with the database is done via
a Representational state transfer [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) interface and
Uniform Resource Identifier [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

Before assuming that you can access remote data learn
about [CORS](http://vividventures.biz/d/?q=node/38).
You definitely do not want to have to learn about
that the hard way.

### Patterns of success
* Learn language syntax, style, and data structures.
* Adopt the tools for the task
* Collaboration, revision level control,
  - DRY Don't repeat your self on a large scale
* Project level architecture and organization
